# Rain-Prediction-using-ann

# About the data:

- The dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from different locations across Australia. Observations were drawn from numerous weather stations.
- In this project, I will use this data to predict whether or not it will rain the next day. There are 23 attributes including the target variable "RainTomorrow", indicating whether or not it will rain the next day or not.
